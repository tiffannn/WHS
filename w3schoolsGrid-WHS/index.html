                The Visual Arts The art curriculum is designed to develop students' <br>
                understanding of art as a visual language.<br>
                Through artistic process students will: create - <br>
                by conceptualizing and developing ideas, <br>
                present - through interpretation, refinement and personal meaning, respond - <br>
                by analyzing art to lead to understanding <br>
                and appreciation, <br>
                and connect - to cultures around them to deepen their understanding of art making. <br>

            <p style="color: #01256F;">
                The Mathematics curriculum attempts to provide <br>
                learning experiences for all students <br>
                consistent with their academic abilities, <br>
                needs, and aspirations. The program offered <br>
                by the Mathematics Department reflects <br>
                an awareness that we live in a complex age <br>
                in which mathematics plays an increasingly <br>
                important role for society and the individual alike. <br>
                The intent of the curriculum is to present<br>
                mathematics as a useful, exciting, and creative area of study <br>
                that can be appreciated, enjoyed, <br>
                and mastered by all students. Particular<br>
                emphasis is placed on understanding <br>
                mathematics with the goal of preparing<br>
                students to adapt in a continuously <br>
                changing, technical world. <br>
                Students will be challenged to achieve <br>
                mathematical power through problem solving, <br>
                communicating mathematically, <br>
                reasoning, and making connections.<br>

                their personal, academic, and professional lives. <br>

                vocabulary development, speaking skills, and cultural <br>
                literacy. WHS's English curriculum is aligned with <br>
